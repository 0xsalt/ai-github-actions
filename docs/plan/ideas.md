[200~Thatâ€™s a sharp idea â€” turning your PARA-shaped note system into a filesystem backed by Git gives you version control, diffing, and the whole GitHub Actions pipeline playground. The trick is mapping the database-like note structure into directories and files in a way thatâ€™s both human-browsable and machine-friendly.

Hereâ€™s a clean, practical recommendation:

---

### Filesystem layout

```
/second-brain/
  /Projects/
    2025-08-20-launch-website/
      note.md
      meta.json
  /Areas/
    health/
      note.md
      meta.json
  /Resources/
    ai-papers/
      note.md
      meta.json
  /Archive/
    old-finance-plan/
      note.md
      meta.json
  /Inbox/
    raw-ideas/
      note.md
      meta.json
  /Trash/   (optional mirror of deleted notes)
```

---

### Inside each note folder

1. **`note.md`** â†’ The main content, human-readable Markdown.

   ```markdown
   # Title: Launch Website
   Content: Hereâ€™s the body of the noteâ€¦
   ```

2. **`meta.json`** â†’ Metadata thatâ€™s structured for scripts and workflows.

   ```json
   {
     "id": "note_7ff06dfd-4db1-42c2-842c-1d9986cf6823",
     "category": "Projects",
     "tags": ["web", "launch"],
     "created_at": "2025-08-20T18:38:57Z",
     "updated_at": "2025-08-25T14:12:00Z",
     "masked_data_detected": false
   }
   ```

---

### Why this makes sense

* **Git-friendly** â†’ Markdown diffs are readable; JSON diffs are machine-parseable.
* **Scalable** â†’ PARA categories are directories, notes are subfolders.
* **Automation** â†’ GitHub Actions can lint JSON, check metadata consistency, auto-categorize, or push changes back to your database.
* **Human-usable** â†’ You can browse and edit notes directly in GitHub or a local editor.

---

An alternative is **flat-file + frontmatter**, where each note is just a single `.md` with YAML frontmatter at the top (no separate JSON). That looks like this:

```markdown
---
id: note_7ff06dfd-4db1-42c2-842c-1d9986cf6823
category: Projects
tags: [web, launch]
created_at: 2025-08-20T18:38:57Z
updated_at: 2025-08-25T14:12:00Z
masked_data_detected: false
---

# Launch Website
Content goes hereâ€¦
```

Thatâ€™s simpler for humans but slightly messier for scripts that want clean metadata.

---

For GitHub Actions, you can:

* Run lint checks (metadata completeness, valid PARA category).
* Auto-generate indexes (like a `README.md` per category).
* Sync back to your live note API if you want bi-directional sync.

---

Would you like me to sketch out a **GitHub Actions workflow** that checks PARA folder consistency and validates metadata, so you can plug this into your repo directly?
